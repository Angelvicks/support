description: 

The file you download and run prompts you for a destination.
If you don't remember what this destination was, it's most likely your Downloads or Desktop folder.

The default setting in the Windows installer also creates a shortcut for you on your Desktop, though be aware that you may have accidentally deselected the option to create a shortcut.

If you can't find it in either of those folders, download it again and look for the prompt that asks you to choose a directory to download it in.
Choose a directory location that you'll remember easily, and once the download finishes you should see a Tor Browser folder there.
