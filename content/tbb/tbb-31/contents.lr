description:

Tor Browser is currently available on [Windows](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#windows), [Linux](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#linux) and [macOS](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#mac).

There is a version of Tor Browser for [Android](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android) and [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info) also provides the app [Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) to route other apps on your Android device over the Tor network.

There is no official version of Tor for iOS yet, though we recommend [Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com).
